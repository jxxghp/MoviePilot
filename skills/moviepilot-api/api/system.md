# System APIs

Version, update, restart, module, network, and usage operations.

## Operations

### `system.module.catalog`
`GET /api/v1/system/module-catalog`; policy effect: `safe_read`.
Purpose: List MoviePilot host modules and service-type options for UI selectors.
- `path_params`: none
- `query`: none
- `body`: none

### `system.module.list`
`GET /api/v1/system/modulelist`; policy effect: `safe_read`.
Purpose: List enabled MoviePilot module IDs and localized names.
- `path_params`: none
- `query`: none
- `body`: none

### `system.module.settings`
`GET /api/v1/system/module-settings`; policy effect: `safe_read`.
Purpose: List built-in MoviePilot modules that can be enabled or disabled by an administrator.
- `path_params`: none
- `query`: none
- `body`: none

### `system.module.test`
`GET /api/v1/system/moduletest/{moduleid}`; policy effect: `external_side_effect`.
Purpose: Run the built-in availability test for one enabled MoviePilot module.
- `path_params`: `moduleid*` (string): Exact loaded module ID returned by system.module.list.
- `query`: none
- `body`: none

### `system.network.targets`
`GET /api/v1/system/nettest/targets`; policy effect: `safe_read`.
Purpose: List approved built-in network-test targets without exposing their request URLs.
- `response`: `data` remains a list; omitting both `page` and `count` keeps the complete legacy result. `collection.result_count` reports the returned items and `collection.total_count` reports the exact pre-pagination total. For counts or summaries, send `page=1,count=1`, read `collection.total_count`, and do not fall back to a database query because the item preview was truncated.
- `path_params`: none
- `query`: `count` (integer|null): Optional page size for a legacy full-list endpoint. Supplying page or count activates pagination; an omitted count then uses 50.; `page` (integer|null): Optional one-based page for a legacy full-list endpoint. Omit both page and count to keep the original unpaginated full result.
- `body`: none

### `system.network.test`
`GET /api/v1/system/nettest`; policy effect: `external_side_effect`.

### `system.versions`
`GET /api/v1/system/versions`; policy effect: `safe_read`.
Purpose: List available MoviePilot GitHub releases.
- `response`: `data` remains a list; omitting both `page` and `count` keeps the complete legacy result. `collection.result_count` reports the returned items and `collection.total_count` reports the exact pre-pagination total.
